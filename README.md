# Insights Agent Desktop App

ðŸš§ This repository is actively under development and should be consider unstable. ðŸš§

This repository houses the code for the Insights Agent desktop application. This application is designed to be used by individuals who have signed up and are selected to participate in a research studies where participants download the desktop app and enable data collection of the following data points.

- device type / operating system
- application names
- tab names (scrubbed for PII)
- domain names
- connectivity (connected to wifi or not)
- device type
- timestamps

Raw data is anonymized and only persisted for a short period of time before it is aggregated and destroyed. The code is setup to be hosted open source on Github in order to leverage the free service [update.electronjs.org](https://github.com/electron/update.electronjs.org) for auto-updating production applications.

## Software Architecture

The bulk of the source code for the app exists in the `src` folder.

## Distribution

ðŸš§ This section us under construction and is considered incomplete. ðŸš§

### MS Windows

The Insights Agent desktop application has initially been developed to study usage of Microsoft Windows computers. The application uses Electron Forge to sign the software with an Extended Validation (EV) token. Currently, this requires building the application on a computer with a thumb-drive with the EV token client.

**Manual code signing process**

This section assumes you have the EV token device and credentials stored in a password manager.

Perform dry run
```
npm run publish:dry-run
```

Sign executable
```
node_modules\electron-winstaller\vendor\signtool.exe sign /a /f "ev-cert.pfx" /p "PASSWORD" "out\insights-agent-desktop-app-win32-x64\insights-agent-desktop-app.exe"
```

Publish from dry-run
```
npm run publish:from-dry-run
```

### MacOSX

The application can run on OSX. This flow is setup to automatically build and sign the app as part of CI.
